									<h2>Mocha Java</h2>
									<h3>Spicy &amp; Deep</h3>
									<p>While many coffee shops sell Mocha Java, very few contain the real thing: Yemen Mocha Mattari. This rare bean has been grown and dry-processed the same way for hundreds of years - and it makes up a full 40 percent of our Mocha Java. To perfectly balance and elicit the legendary Mocha qualities, we blend it with Java, Costa Rica, and Ethiopia Harrar.</p>
									<h4>Tasting Notes: </h4>
									<p>This is a robust, spicy, intensely fruity blend with hints of bittersweet chocolate, blueberries and wild honey in a big, bold body. Due to the heavy percentage of naturally processed coffee in this blend, it packs a level of sweetness and fruitiness not present in many other blends.</p>
									<h4>Roastmaster's Notes: </h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Rich, spicy, medium-dark roast</li>
											<li>Wild honey high notes</li>
											<li>Chocolate mousse body and sweetness</li>
											<li>Memorable, relaxing blend</li>
